# Code Race

Code Race is a website that allows you to run benchmark tests for different programming languages. You can select the test you want to run from the navbar at the top of the page.

## Available Tests

Currently, the following tests are available on Code Race:

- Fetch Test: Measures the time it takes to retrieve and parse a JSON file from a server. This test is useful for measuring the performance of networking and data processing in different programming languages.
- Quicksort Test: Measures the time it takes to sort an array of numbers using the Quicksort algorithm. This test is useful for measuring the performance of sorting algorithms and the general computational speed of different programming languages.

To run a test, simply click on the corresponding link in the navbar. The results of the test will be displayed on the page, along with the time it took to complete the test.

## Languages Available

Currently, Code Race supports the following programming languages:

- Node.js
- Rust
- Python
